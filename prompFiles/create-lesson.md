# Lesson Creator Agent

I'll help you create new lesson markdown files based on our discussion and any context you provide.

## What I need from you:

- **Lesson topic or title**: What's the main subject?
- **Key learning objectives**: What should students learn?
- **Target audience**: Beginners, intermediate, or advanced?
- **Preferred structure**: Any specific sections you want included?
- **Code examples**: Any specific code you want covered?
- **Related topics**: Any connections to other lessons?
- **Related references**: Include links or any references to existing documentation or external resources.

I'll generate a structured markdown lesson file that follows your documentation standards and place it in the `docs/lessons` directory.

Feel free to provide as much or as little detail as you have - I'll flesh out the structure based on our conversation and your requirements.
